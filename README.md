# 🌐 ServerLogHub – Synthetic Server Log Collection

**ServerLogHub** is a curated collection of **synthetic server logs** designed for **AI-driven log analytics, cybersecurity research, anomaly detection, and full-stack dashboard projects**.  

These logs simulate **real-world server behavior**, including normal traffic, errors, API calls, and malicious patterns, so you can safely build, test, and demonstrate your security tools or dashboards.

## 🔍 Project Overview

ServerLogHub provides datasets that mimic realistic server operations:

- Normal user traffic and browsing patterns  
- System and application errors  
- Authentication and security events  
- API requests with success/failure patterns  
- Malicious behavior: reconnaissance, brute-force, scanning attempts  
- Firewall and system/kernel events  

All logs are **synthetic and safe for public use**, but realistic enough for research, experimentation, or portfolio projects.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Realistic Traffic Patterns:** Normal browsing, API usage, static asset loads  
- **Malicious Activity Simulation:** Recon scanning, brute-force login attempts, SQLi/XSS probes  
- **Variety:** Multiple IP ranges, user-agents, HTTP methods, timestamps, and error types  
- **AI/ML Ready:** Ideal for anomaly detection, AI-driven threat detection, and dashboard testing
